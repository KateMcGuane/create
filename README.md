# Hobby

This is a website for Hobby, a fictional recreational directory. The main purpose of the website is to easily connect hobbyists with facilitators alike.

It is designed with ease of access in mind. This website exists to showcase hobby facilitators in your area that may otherwise go unheard of. It is to highlight the presence of businesses, clubs and activities you may not know exist due to a lack of online presence.

## Design

The website is designed with separate pages. This is to ensure ease of use, and for the length of each page to remain concise on a mobile device. The website is a directory and will be used as a hub for quick access to facilities and respective socials.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the website illustrates variety and fun through the colour palette. 100s of Thousands were the inspiration for this palette of choice.

This palette reflects the hero image that is features across each webpage. Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

This palette has stronger tones to it. It is used primarily for elements such as headings or areas of highlighted interest. This is to illustrate contrast and essential elements of importance.

Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Both fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Fredericka The Great

  - This has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, and mirrors the chosen style of favicon.

- Poppins
  - This is a legible font with many varieties of weight to choose from. It is versatile and accomodates all structural styling needs. It is a very accessible font, and easy to read.

### Imagery

All images were source from [Raw Pixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/).

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Summary of Pages

- The About page is a general landing page that describes the website.
- The Discovery page features a gallery of the range of hobbies available in rows of three on desktop and collapse responsively with decreasing screen size. This page illustrates what is available through the website with simple visual cues.
- The Signup page features a one way means of contact. The sole purpose is to collect potential customer and facilitator contact information.
- The Response page is only activated when the user clicks the 'Subscribe' button for the signup page.

#### Reoccuring Page Features

- The navigation is visible on all pages. The favicon styles are refelcted in the header. There is a paintbrush icon to give an idea as to what the page is about. This has a toggle feature that links to each page when using smaller devices.
- Each page features a hero image of sprinkles with other information being layered on top.
- The footer is a focal point that stands out clearly with a white background. This is carried throughout each page.

### Future Implementations

Aspects that could elevate the current website:

- Link in real-life businesses.
- Add a map feature on the discover page to said businesses.
- Add contact informtion.

The current website acts as a free directory. There is potential to devleop the concept further by:

- Adding a login page whereby the user can review the listed businesses.
  - - Add filter column to the directory with features such as "Onsite Parking", "Wheelchair Accessible" and "Sensory Friendly" to name a few. This way people can find the best service to suit their essential needs.
- Integrating e-commerce to the website where businesses can opt-in to sell from the website if they do not have one themselves.
- Create an app version of the website that makes its easy for all user types.

### Accessibility

The entire website was designed with a responsive-first ethos in mind.

## Credits

### Markup

- The general format of my markup is based on the [readme-examples](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-readme.md) work by [Kera Cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore).
- I used this [milestone-testing.md](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-testing.md) as a guide to writing my own [TESTING.md] file, along with the corresponding [example](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Found-In-Translation/blob/main/TESTING.md#found-in-translation----testing-documentation).

### Code Used

- I followed the format of the Love Running Walkthrough Project. This was to ensure best practice in creating my first interactive Front-End web application.

### Content

I wrote the content for the website myself.

###  Media

- Favicon: I created the favicon with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Their selection of artworks had more variety & compatibility for application as a favicon.
