# Hobby

This is a website for Hobby, a fictional recreational directory. The main purpose of the website is to easily connect hobbyists with facilitators alike.

It is designed with ease of access in mind. This website exists to showcase hobby facilitators in your area that may otherwise go unheard of. It is to highlight the presence of businesses, clubs and activities you may not know exist due to a lack of online presence.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

#### Client Goals

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To serve as a community directory for hobbies, and link hobbyists with facilitators.
- To link in with users in the form af a newsletter.
- To direct visitors to our socials.

#### Visitor Goals

- I want to find out what Hobby is, and if it has the activity that I'm looking for.
- I want a website that's easy to navigate.
- I want to find the information I'm looking for with ease.
- I want to be able to find them on socials.

## Design

The website is designed with separate pages. This is to ensure ease of use, and for the length of each page to remain concise on a mobile device. The website is a directory and will be used as a hub for quick access to facilities and respective socials.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the website illustrates variety and fun through the colour palette. 100s of Thousands were the inspiration for this palette of choice.

This palette reflects the hero image that is features across each webpage. Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

![Hobby Website Colour Palette](docs/sprinkles-23.png)

This palette has stronger tones to it. It is used primarily for elements such as headings or areas of highlighted interest. This is to illustrate contrast and essential elements of importance.

![Hobby Website Colour Palette](docs/sprinkles-20.png)

Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Both fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Fredericka The Great

  - This has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, and mirrors the chosen style of favicon.

- Poppins
  - This is a legible font with many varieties of weight to choose from. It is versatile and accomodates all structural styling needs. It is a very accessible font, and easy to read.

### Imagery

All images were source from [Raw Pixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/).

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Summary of Pages

- The About page is a general landing page that describes the website.
- The Discovery page features a gallery of the range of hobbies available in rows of three on desktop and collapse responsively with decreasing screen size. This page illustrates what is available through the website with simple visual cues.
- The Signup page features a one way means of contact. The sole purpose is to collect potential customer and facilitator contact information.
- The response page is only activated when the user clicks the 'Subscribe' button for the signup page.

#### Reoccuring Page Features

- The navigation is visible on all pages. The favicon styles are refelcted in the header. There is a paintbrush icon to give an idea as to what the page is about. This has a toggle feature that links to each page when using smaller devices.
- Each page features a hero image of sprinkles with other information being layered on top.
- The footer is a focal point that stands out clearly with a white background. This is carried throughout each page.

### Future Implementations

Aspects that could elevate the current website:

- Link in real-life businesses.
- Add a map feature on the discover page to said businesses.
- Add contact informtion.

The current website acts as a free directory. There is potential to devleop the concept further by:

- Adding a login page whereby the user can review the listed businesses.
  - - Add filter column to the directory with features such as "Onsite Parking", "Wheelchair Accessible" and "Sensory Friendly" to name a few. This way people can find the best service to suit their essential needs.
- Integrating e-commerce to the website where businesses can op-in to sell from the website if they do not have one themselves.
- Create an app version of the website that makes its easy for all user types.

### Accessibility

The entire website was designed with a responsive-first ethos in mind.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The site was deployed early using Github Pages. The is how the live site was deployed:

1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.
2. Find the repository for this project, Kate McGuane / hobby.
3. Click on the Settings link.
4. Click on the Pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.
5. In the Source section, choose main from the drop down select branch menu. Select Root from the drop down select folder menu.
6. Click Save. Your live Github Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

## Testing

The website was tested manually throughout the project development using DevTools to check for responsiveness.

### Markup

The general format of my markup is based on the sample work by kera-cudmore.

- readme-examples/milestone1-readme.md

### Code Used

- I followed the format of the Love Running Walkthrough Project. This was to ensure best practice in creating my first interactive Front-End web application.
-

### Content

I wrote the majority of the content for the website myself.

### ¬†Media

- Favicon: I created the favicon with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Their selection of artworks had more variety & compatibility for application as a favicon.

### ¬†Acknowledgments

- A huge thank you to my mentor, Alex, who helped me resolve any major issues.
- My dear friend, Sarah, you are a wonderful teacher, and gave valauble insight.
- My partner, Mikhail, for keeping me well fed and hydrated throughout this project.
- To my tutor Laura, who provided a sense of calm when needed most. Your forewarnings were very useful, and acurate.
