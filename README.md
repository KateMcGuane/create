# Hobby

This is a website for Hobby, a fictional recreational directory. The main purpose of the website is to easily connect hobbyists with facilitators alike.

It is designed with ease of access in mind. This website exists to showcase hobby facilitators in your area that may otherwise go unheard of. It is to highlight the presence of businesses, clubs and activities you may not know exist due to a lack of online presence.

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

#### Client Goals

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To serve as a community directory for hobbies, and link hobbyists with facilitators.
- To link in with users in the form af a newsletter.
- To direct visitors to our socials.

#### Visitor Goals

- I want to find out what Hobby is, and if it has the activity that I'm looking for.
- I want a website that's easy to navigate.
- I want to find the information I'm looking for with ease.
- I want to be able to find them on socials.

## Design

The website is designed with separate pages. This is to ensure ease of use, and for the length of each page to remain concise on a mobile device. The website is a directory and will be used as a hub for quick access to facilities and respective socials.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the website illustrates variety and fun through the colour palette. 100s of Thousands were the inspiration for this palette of choice.

This palette reflects the hero image that is features across each webpage. Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

![Hobby Website Colour Palette](docs/sprinkles-23.png)

This palette has stronger tones to it. It is used primarily for elements such as headings or areas of highlighted interest. This is to illustrate contrast and essential elements of importance.

![Hobby Website Colour Palette](docs/sprinkles-20.png)

Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Both fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Fredericka The Great

  - This has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, and mirrors the chosen style of favicon.

- Poppins
  - This is a legible font with many varieties of weight to choose from. It is versatile and accomodates all structural styling needs. It is a very accessible font, and easy to read.

### Imagery

All images were source from [Raw Pixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/).

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

Aspects that could elevate the current website:

- Link in real-life businesses.
- Add a map feature on the discover page to said businesses.
- Add contact informtion.

The current website acts as a free directory. There is potential to devleop the concept further by:

- Adding a login page whereby the user can review the listed businesses.
  - - Add filter column to the directory with features such as "Onsite Parking", "Wheelchair Accessible" and "Sensory Friendly" to name a few. This way people can find the best service to suit their essential needs.
- Integrating e-commerce to the website where businesses can op-in to sell from the website if they do not have one themselves.
- Create an app version of the website that makes its easy for all user types.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

### Deployment

The site was deployed early using Github Pages. The is how the live site was deployed:

1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.
2. Find the repository for this project, Kate McGuane / hobby.
3. Click on the Settings link.
4. Click on the Pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.
5. In the Source section, choose main from the drop down select branch menu. Select Root from the drop down select folder menu.
6. Click Save. Your live Github Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

### Markup

The general format of my markup is based on the sample work by kera-cudmore.

- readme-examples/milestone1-readme.md

### Code Used

- I followed the format of the Love Running Walkthrough Project. This was to ensure best practice in creating my first interactive Front-End web application.
-

### Content

I wrote the majority of the content for the website myself.

### ¬†Media

- Favicon: I created the favicon with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Their selection of artworks had more variety & compatibility for application as a favicon.

### ¬†Acknowledgments

- A huge thank you to my mentor, Alex, who helped me resolve any major issues.
- My dear friend, Sarah, you are a wonderful teacher, and gave valauble insight.
- My partner, Mikhail, for keeping me well fed and hydrated throughout this project.
